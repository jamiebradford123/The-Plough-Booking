# The Plough Pub

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of this section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#bully-book-club-website)

The Plough Website is designed to be a responsive website on a range of devices such as a mobile and laptop. This site allows visitors to find out more information about The Plough
Pub and let them make a reservation if they wish. I build this website as this is a local business I attend reguarlly, but they lack an online presence. With this website it should
allow people to find out more about the business and make a reservation, as many people do not visit places without the guarentee of a seat.


Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.

If you want to add optional [shields.io](https://shields.io) badges to your README, I like to add them to this section.

## User Experience (UX)

The Plough website allows users to do multiple things, such as make, edit or cancel a reservation. Users will also be able to view, like and comment on events that will be occuring at the pub. 

Having an online presence will help boost this businesses returns, as it will reach a wider audience who will be able to see what food, drink and events the Plough offers. First time users and especially those that have never visited the establishment may discover something that interests them and encourage them to book and visit the Pub. Returning members can keep visiting to see the latest events and edit/cancel or make another booking. 

# Client goals
- To recieve bookings from customers 
- To be able to accept, edit and cancel bookings
- To be able to display the pubs menu's to viewers

# First time visitor goals
- To be able to gain more information about the pub (address, contact information etc)
- To be able to make a booking for the pub
- To be able to edit and cancel their bookings

# Returning visitor goals
- Can edit and cancel previous bookings
- To book a table again

# Frequent visitors
- View previous and current bookings and edit and cancel them

## Design

### Colour Scheme

I decided to go for darker greys and white color scheme, as it matches the images I would be using. It also gives a more classier feel which matches the pub itself, and I want users to feel this is a fancy establishement.


ADD COLOR PALLETE 

### Typography

4 fonts where used in the making of this project, Lato, Playfair Display, Roboto Slab and Montserrat.

Playfair display was used as it most reflected the real world logo of The Plough. As for the other fonts, I ensured they matched the style of the website and they are clear and easy to read. Roboto Slab was used on the main page as it is bolder and larger, which will draw attention to it

ADD FONT IMAGES


[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is a popular choice for importing fonts to use in your project, as it doesn't require you to download the fonts to use them.

### Imagery

The images used on this site are meant to be images of the pub itself. As this is an example project, real images are not available, therefore images that closely reflect the Plough pub have been used. On the menu page, the images used are to show some of the products related to said menu that the Plough sell. 

### Wireframes

Add the images or links for your wireframes here.


## Features

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Features)

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Technologies Used section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#Technologies-Used)

### Languages Used

Make a note here of all the languages used in creating your project. For the first project this will most likely just be HTML & CSS.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

## Credits

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Credits section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm#Credits)

The Credits section is where you can credit all the people and sources you used throughout your project.

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.

### ¬†Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
  
### ¬†Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
